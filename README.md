### LINUX platform 
The file `TestTimeAndSpaceOnTerminal.cpp` can easily be use for multiple input size and together determine the time and space used by each input size through algorithms various operations.
Assuming in the package directory (the directory of the opened package with available files)
- compile...
```sh 
g++ R-Tree.h R-tree.cpp TestTimeAndSpaceOnTerminal.cpp -o "name of executable file that will be produced e.g. test"
```
- run...
> for an input size ranging from 10 to 50 with a step of 10(which can be modified as needed)
```sh
for i in {10..50..10}; do ./test $i; done
```

### Windows platform
The file `test1.cpp` can be use for random generation of input points with an input size specified in the file `test1.cpp` through the constant `INPUT_SIZE`. However if need of manual input arise, then the file `main.cpp` can be used for a step by step interaction with the algorithm.
